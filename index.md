# Ke Ye

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT),  
advised by **Prof. [Zhiwei Zhang](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/bssds/11ecdda7276a4202ac64fb245bdab419.htm)**.  
I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science from BIT in 2024.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA)**.  
I am particularly interested in combining language models with structured knowledge to build more robust and interpretable question-answering systems.
